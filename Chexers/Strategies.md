Chexers Strategies
====

### Opening Stage:
1. Play random / safe moves until another piece is capturable
2. *Look into finding moves that are more likely to win (such as corner tile heuristics for n-puzzles, centre column connect 4, 4 move checkmate in chess, etc)*

### Mid Stage:
1. Blocking **exit actions**
2. Attempt to convert all opponent pieces
3. Do a runner to the edge and attempt to exit the board

### To Dos:
- Play the game (print on carboard and see how that goes)
- Find positions that are weighted more crucially compared to others

### Alpha-Beta:
I guess if one strategy is "the winning one", then we can just follow that and prune the rest.
