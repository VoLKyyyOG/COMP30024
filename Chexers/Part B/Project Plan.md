COMP30024 - Artificial Intelligence | Project Plan
===================================
##### Team: _blank_
##### Team Members: Akira Wang, Callum Holmes

#### Project Approach
Treating the problem as a multi stage game.
1. Start Game - random moves / Monte Carlo booking
2. Mid Game - Using an agent with multiple strategies (MP-Mix)
3. End Game - Negascout / Negamax_alpha-beta

We have split the project into several sub-projects.
1. Mechanics which define the important game mechanics
2. Moves which define any move related actions in the game
3. Algorithms which contains all algorithm related implementations (including heuristics)
4. Player which pulls dependencies from all other modules and talks to the referee

#### Project Workload
- Work on different stages concurrently
- Split report writing
- Implement core game mechanics and functions
- Maintain communication to stay up to date with latest pushes
