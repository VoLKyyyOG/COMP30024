COMP30024 - Artificial Intelligence | Project Plan
===================================
##### Team: _blank_
##### Team Members: Akira Wang, Callum Holmes

#### Project Approach
Treating the problem as a multi stage game.
1. Start Game - random moves / Monte Carlo booking
2. Mid Game - Using an agent with multiple strategies (MP-Mix)
3. End Game - Negascout / Negamax_alpha-beta if 2 players left; or booking if few pieces remain; or MP-Mix

We have split the project into several sub-projects.
1. Mechanics - which defines the important game mechanics
2. Moves - which defines any move related actions in the game
3. Algorithms - which contains all algorithm related implementations (including heuristics)
4. Player - which pulls dependencies from all other modules and talks to the referee

#### Project Workload
- Work on different stages concurrently
- Split report writing
- Implement core game mechanics and functions
- Maintain communication to stay up to date with latest pushes
