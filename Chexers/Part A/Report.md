# Focus questions

#### How have you formulated the game as a search problem?
(You could discuss how you view the problem in terms of states, actions, goal tests, and path costs, for example.)

#### What search algorithm does your program use to solve this problem, and why did you choose this algorithm?
(You could comment on the algorithm’s efficiency, completeness, and optimality. You could explain any
heuristics you may have developed to inform your search, including commenting on their admissibility.)

#### What features of the problem and your program’s input impact your program’s time and space requirements?
(You might discuss the branching factor and depth of your search tree, and explain any other features of the
input which affect the time and space complexity of your algorithm.)

## Problem Formulation (answers Q1)
States: the exact number and positions of each player piece, and each block. 
Actions:
Goal tests:
Path costs:

## Algorithmic Approach

### Heuristic

"Jumping manhattan"

#### Explain and justify

### Search algorithm

"IDA*" + "TT" = "TIDA*"

#### Explain and Justify

## Effectiveness of Approach

### Asymptotic Time-Space Complexity Analysis

### Branching (does it get dense? Is it wasting time on expansions?)
What does the problem contribute to this issue?
Does the input or its features impact this?
What features of the problem allowed us to reduce branching?

### Depth (does it explore beyond optimal depth?)
What does the problem contribute to this issue?
Does the input or its features impact this?
What features of the problem allowed us to reduce branching?
